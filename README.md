# HCryptoAPI
Provides access to new ciphers and hash functions

Hash algorithms based on cycle shift are considered to be insecure, do not use them!
It is also not recommended to use HEncryBIT block-cipher, as its security based only on randomness of key.

RSA modules require Rudy Velthuis' library of BigIntegers for Delphi.
