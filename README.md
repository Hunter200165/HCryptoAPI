# Important information: This repository is not just old, it is extremely old. Do not use it under normal conditions.
Just a ~year ago I started to work on solid cryptographical library called HBrokenSSL which should contain cryptographic primitives and also be a base for implementation of secure-communication protocols. After some time I will finally push it on the github, so if you are interested in some features - you can always find me on my discord, that is written directly in my profile. Good luck and do not use this obsolete repository, please =P

# HCryptoAPI
Provides access to new ciphers and hash functions

Hash algorithms based on cycle shift are considered to be insecure, do not use them!
It is also not recommended to use HEncryBIT block-cipher, as its security based only on randomness of key.

RSA modules require Rudy Velthuis' library of BigIntegers for Delphi.
